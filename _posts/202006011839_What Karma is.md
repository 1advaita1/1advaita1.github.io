## What Karma is
#Definition Karma is real, but it's a scam. If I something bad happens to me due to someone else's actions, they say it's a result of my past karma. But if I'd hurt someone, it's my bad karma, and not a result of their past bad actions.

Fir laga, after I die, thousands of animals will be born. Even if reincarnation is true, Who will know ki ye wala insaan pehle Suraj tha, and ye insaan Suraj nahi tha? My sense of being alive is the same as their sense of being alive. They will never know if they were Suraj in an earlier birth. Also, the total population on earth keeps increasing/decreasing. Aisa thodi hai ki the number of souls in existence keeps changing. Soul ek discrete entity thodi hai. It's a small reflection of a whole.

So if a soul exists and karma is real, then there is only one soul. Soul ne bura karm kiya, toh soul ko bura fal mila. Doesn't matter which soul, because dono souls same hain.
