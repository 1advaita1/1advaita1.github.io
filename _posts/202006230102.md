That we can decide to change what we do, but we can't simply decide to change what we want. If we keep trying to want something else, our success in it will be temporary. We will turn back to our old wants in a few days, unless we manage to turn our new want into a satisfactory habit.
That's why I could never succeed in anything I wanted to do, in college.
I wanted many things very strongly, but I wanted them only temporarily.
Those wants kept going, then coming back later, but then they disappeared again and frequently got replaced by different wants.

I could simply not decide which things I wanted more. I couldn't even prioritize health over night-time debates, and studies over bakchodi during exam times.
And ab bhi, even though I liked thesis wala topic, I couldn't actually prioritize it enough to work on it for a few hours every single day.
Vidhate bhaiya se baat hui thi, kuch din pehle. Mast 2 ghante call chala. He advised this: treat your decisions as something sacred. Think very hard before deciding something, but baar kuch decide kar liya, toh don't give up on it whatever may happen, even if you aren't comfortable. Decisions should never almost never be reverted.
Isko seriously laana hai life me.
