## What Strength is
#Definition: Strength could be the ability to achieve the goals I really want to, and the lack of qualities which prevent me from achieving them. 

In every context, strength of an entity would imply an absence of weakness. Every entity is part of a larger system, and is usually composed of smaller entities. Weakness can be seen as the property of a system - the system stops working/or breaks down in certain conditions. If the system is my life, then weakness would be bad habits which ruin its structure. 

If the entity is my mind, strength includes the qualities which help me further my life in the #good direction.
